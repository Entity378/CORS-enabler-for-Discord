# CORS-enabler-for-Discord
I created this script with the goal of fixing the random unload of the discord UI. \
The unload happens because of a CORS error made by a discord call itself. \
This script allows that kind of call so that the UI does not unload. \
you have to paste the index.js file in this folder : \
`"C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\Discord\app-1.0.9198\modules\discord_desktop_core-1\discord_desktop_core\"`
